#summary Frequently Asked Questions


## Can I use _cocos2d for iPhone_ in my closed-source iPhone application ? ##

Yes, you can.

_cocos2d for iPhone_ is licensed under the 'cocos2d for iPhone license'. Basically it is like a LGPL license but allows you to use the library as a static library or by including the _cocos2d for iPhone_ sources in your project.

Remember that _cocos2d for iPhone_ follows the copyleft idea. So if you improve the library, send me the patches or make them public so that I can include them in future releases.

If you have any doubt, please read the 'cocos2d for iPhone license':

## Can I use 3D objects in cocos2d ? ##

You can include some 3D objects in your 2d game to improve the quality of your graphics without any problem.

Also, the default projection matrix of cocos2d is a 3D one, so probably you won't need to change it.
